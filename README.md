AppGyver Steroids Add-ons Kitchensink
===========

This project demonstrates the features of [Steroids Add-ons](http://www.appgyver.com/steroids/addons/), which gives you access to a collection of premium, turn-key implementations for common mobile app features. Currently included add-ons are:

* Facebook
* Geolocation
* OAuth.io

## Installation

Steroids Add-ons is only available to subscribers. You can get a subscription on the [AppGyver website](http://www.appgyver.com/steroids/addons/).

Once you've got an active Add-ons subscription, you can download the `steroids-addons.js` file from the [AppGyver Cloud](http://addons.appgyver.com). You can also find links to the Steroids Add-ons Guides and API docs there.
  
(Run `$ steroids deploy` in a Steroids project folder to deploy an application to the cloud if you haven't done this before.)

## Running

Run

    $ steroids connect

in the project root, then scan the QR code with [AppGyver Scanner for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/appgyver-scanner/id575076515).

## Configuration

The `www/config.xml` file holds configuration options for the Add-ons. Note that to change the Facebook App ID, you need to build a custom scanner.
